      <p>I am a graduate student at Univerity of of Alberta. I am in my second-year of Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and my major is in Communications. I am a research assistant under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~mkhabbaz/" target="_blank">Dr. Majid Khabbazian</a>, and I am doing research on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). I am also involved in a project on smart monitoring of livestock using a wireless sensor network of embedded systems. Since continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me, I started exploring object oriented languages like Java through my masterâ€™s program. With respect to the ever growing application of scripting languages and agile programming paradigm, I switched to Ruby and Rails so I could proceed toward web development. In this regard, I also started getting familiar with more modern front-end frameworks such as AngularJS.</p>
      <p>I did my Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, and my major was in Electronics. In my undergraduate studies, I was focused on three main topics of:</p>
      <ul class="undergrad-interest">
        <li> Embedded Systems (design and coding)</li>
        <li> Digital System Design (using VHDl and Verilog hardware programming) </li>
        <li> Computer Architecture </li>
      </ul>
<!--       <p>My BSc. project was to develop a web server on an embedded system which used ARM processor: AT91SAM7x256. This project involved C++ coding and web design</p>   -->
      <p> More details on the main projects that I have done through my undergraduate and graduate studies are provided in the <a href="#projects">Projects</a> section.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/KeyvanGSaffar/MST-minimum-spanning-tree.git" target="_blank">Simulation of a non-cooperative broadcast algorithm (Current)</a></h3>
          <p>In this project, I am simulating a non-cooperative broadcast algorithm for Wireless and Ad-Hoc Sensor Networks presented in the paper <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6353616/" target="_blank">"An Exponential Improvement on the MST Heuristic for Minimum Energy Broadcasting in Ad Hoc Wireless Networks"</a>. To do so, I needed to use a programming language that was fast and efficient. Therefore, I chose to code in C++ language. </p>

          <p> This is a classic phone book implementation having most of the capabilities of a typical phone book program (application) such as adding, deletting, updating, or searching for contact entries.

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/KeyvanGSaffar/BSc.-Project.git" target="_blank">Advancement of a Web Server on an ARM-based Embedded System (BSc. project)</a></h3>
          <p>This project was done in cooperation with my friend, Seyyed Farshad Kazemi at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. We started with simple web server code, and developed it on an embedded system which used an ARM processor (AT91SAM7x256). the code of the simple web server was provided by the system (board) manufacturer. The project involved two main parts of C++ coding and web design. For the C++ coding, it required manipulation of processor's registers, which required familiarity with the board's schematic and datasheets of processor and other ICs that were used on the board. In addition, we developed the server-side of web server to respond to the requests sent from users. For the front-end, we developed web designs for the users and added extra pages to represent the real-time data that was generated by the sensors that were connected to the board.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/KeyvanGSaffar/Blockus-Competition.git" target="_blank">FPGA Design Contest (Blockus Contest)</a></h3>
          <p>This is project done through the 1st National Digital System Design Contest of Iran. This Contest was consisted of two categories: 1) FPGA Design Contest and 2) Hardware-Software Co-design Competition. We participated in the fisrt category as a 3-member team including to Electronics engineer and one Software engineer. The contest was a live event of a two-player blokus-duo game where the contestants designed hardware modules on FPGA to perform as one player of the game. The contestant designs competed against one another in a live league on the final day of the contest. The rules applied to the competition where similiar to the rules in <a href="http://lut.eee.u-ryukyu.ac.jp/dc13/" target="_blank">ICFPT 2013 Design Competition: Blokus Duo</a>. We had our design written in VHDL language and the FPGA board that was used in the competition was Altera DE2.</p>
